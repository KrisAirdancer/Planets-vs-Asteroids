# Planets-vs-Asteroids
A simple game made for my CS 1410 class - Introduction to Object Oriented Programming.

We were provided with some base code to guide our structuring of the game.
I added a few classes to the base code to add new sprite types to replace the
default ones and to give them new functionality.

I added other modifications to the base code to ensure that the new sprites
were able to operate properly, to improve the base game's functionality
(added a sprite selection menu & changed enemy spawn rates/probabilities),
and to re-theme the game more generally (chnged colors & added a new background).
